## What is MongoDB ?

MongoDB is a popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database that is designed for high performance, scalability, and flexibility. It stores data in a flexible, JSON-like document format, which allows for a more natural and intuitive way of representing complex data structures.

MongoDB is known for its ability to handle large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data, making it a popular choice for applications that require high scalability and performance. It also provides a highly available and fault-tolerant system through its built-in replication and sharding features.

Some key features of MongoDB include:

1.Flexible data model: MongoDB stores data in flexible, schema-free documents, which allows for easy and fast updates to data structures.

2.High performance: MongoDB is designed to provide high performance for both read and write operations, with features such as in-memory caching and automatic indexing.

3.Scalability: MongoDB provides built-in horizontal scaling through sharding, which allows for distribution of data across multiple servers.

4.Rich query language: MongoDB provides a powerful and flexible query language that supports a wide range of queries, including ad-hoc queries, indexing, and aggregation.

### MongoDB Commands

- show dbs : Shows a list of all databases on the MongoDB server.
- use <database-name> : Switches to the specified database or creates it if it doesn't exist.
- db.createCollection("<collection-name>") : Creates a new collection in the current database.
- db.<collection-name>.insertOne(<document>) : Inserts a new document into the specified collection.
- db.<collection-name>.insertMany([<document1>, <document2>, ...]) : Inserts multiple documents into the specified collection.
- db.<collection-name>.find() : Returns all documents in the specified collection.
- db.<collection-name>.findOne() : Returns the first document in the specified collection.
- db.<collection-name>.find(<query>) : Returns documents that match the specified query in the specified collection.
- db.<collection-name>.updateOne(<query>, <update>) : Updates the first doc that matches the specified query in the collection.
- db.<collection-name>.updateMany(<query>, <update>): Updates all docs that match the specified query in the specified collection.
- db.<collection-name>.deleteOne(<query>) : Deletes the first doc that matches specified query in specified collection.
- db.<collection-name>.deleteMany(<query>) : Deletes all docs that match the specified query in the specified collection.
- db.<collection-name>.drop() : Deletes the specified collection.
- db.dropDatabase() : Deletes the current database.

### What is Mongoose?

Mongoose is an Object-Document Mapping (ODM) library for Node.js that provides a more straightforward and intuitive way to interact with MongoDB databases.

Mongoose provides a schema-based solution to model application data and provides a number of helpful features, such as validation, middleware, and a powerful querying API. Mongoose also provides built-in support for defining relationships between models and for populating referenced documents.

One of the main benefits of using Mongoose is that it simplifies the interaction with MongoDB, which is a document-based NoSQL database. Mongoose provides an abstraction layer that allows developers to interact with MongoDB using JavaScript objects and methods, instead of directly interacting with raw MongoDB queries.

Here's a simple example of using Mongoose to define a schema and create a model for a "Todo" collection:

```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const todoSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  text: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  completed: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false,
  },
});

const Todo = mongoose.model("Todo", todoSchema);
```

In this example, we define a todoSchema using the mongoose.Schema constructor, which specifies the structure of a todo document in the MongoDB collection. We then create a Todo model using the mongoose.model method, which is used to interact with the MongoDB collection.

Once the model is defined, we can use its methods, such as find, create, update, and delete, to interact with the MongoDB collection in a more intuitive way than with raw MongoDB queries.

Overall, Mongoose is a powerful tool that simplifies working with MongoDB and provides many helpful features for building scalable and maintainable Node.js applications.

### Mongoose methods

- mongoose.connect() : Connects to a MongoDB database using a URI.
- mongoose.connection : Represents the connection to the MongoDB database.
- mongoose.Schema() : Defines the structure of a MongoDB document.
- mongoose.model() : Creates a model from a schema, which can be used to interact with a MongoDB collection.
- save() : Saves a document to the associated MongoDB collection.
- find() : Returns an array of documents that match the specified query.
- findById() : Returns a single document that matches the specified ID.
- findOne() : Returns a single document that matches the specified query.
- updateOne() : Updates the first document that matches the specified query.
- updateMany() : Updates all documents that match the specified query.
- deleteOne() : Deletes the first document that matches the specified query.
- deleteMany() : Deletes all documents that match the specified query.
- populate() : Populates a field reference in a document with data from another collection.
- select() : Specifies which fields to include or exclude in a query result.
- sort() : Specifies the order in which query results should be sorted.
- limit() : Specifies the maximum number of documents to return in a query result.
- skip() : Specifies the number of documents to skip in a query result.
- aggregate() : Performs aggregation operations, such as grouping and counting, on a collection.
